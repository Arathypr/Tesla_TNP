      " Charge anywhere there is electricity. Most range used for daily driving can be topped off using the Mobile Connector Bundle and a 110V household outlet, or upgrade to a 220V Tesla Wall Connector for the best home charging experience. For long distance travel, Model Y adds up to 160 miles of range in just 15 minutes using Tesla’s Supercharger network, getting you back on the road, sooner.",

    review:
      "Model Y features 76 ft³ of cargo space accessible through both the front trunk and the automatically opening and closing rear trunk. Taking advantage of the space traditionally occupied by bulky engines, gas tanks and transmissions, the design of Model Y enables disproportionately large amounts of storage for a car its size, while bolstering occupant safety through a more spacious, reinforced body and chassis.",
